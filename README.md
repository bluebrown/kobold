# Kobold

`Kobold` is a gitbot that automates the process of updating container image tags
in a git repository. It listens for `webhook events` triggered by a container
registry, and automatically updates the image tag in the git repository when a
new image is pushed.

## Motivation

Manually updating image tags in a git repository can be a time-consuming and
error-prone process. Kobold was created to automate this process and make it
easier for developers to keep their image tags up to date. It is meant to be a
companion to other gitops tools such as `ArgoCD` or `FluxCD`, which will monitor
for changes in git repositories. So an image tag update by kobold might kick of
a application rollout with using the new version.

## Documentation

The documentation is hosted via github pages and can be viewed at
<https://bluebrown.github.io/kobold>.

## Quick Start

You can review the [example manifests](./manifests/example/) to see a possible
setup.

Typically you would deploy `kobold` to `kubernetes` providing your own config
file and environment variables for secrets.

For example using kustomize:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - https://github.com/bluebrown/kobold/releases/latest/download/kobold.manifests.yaml
  - ingress.yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: kobold-config
    behavior: replace
    files:
      - ./etc/config.yaml
secretGenerator:
  - name: kobold-env
    behavior: replace
    envs:
      - ./etc/.env
```

The above config requires to add create some additional resources. Below is the
config file for kobold. Adjust this to your needs.

```yaml
version: v1

endpoints:
  - name: myacr
    type: acr
    path: /acr/107ed4ca-591a-4fee-b6b2-65ef184bb582
    requiredHeaders:
      - key: Authorization
        value: ${SECRET_TOKEN}

repositories:
  - name: github-kobold
    url: https://github.com/bluebrown/kobold
    username: "${MY_GIT_EMAIL}"
    password: "${MY_GIT_PAT}"

subscriptions:
  - name: kobold
    endpointRefs:
      - name: myacr
    repositoryRef:
      name: github-kobold
    branch: main
    strategy: commit
```

In addition to the above config file, an env file is used for secrets. `Kobold`
will resolve env var references in the config file.

```console
MY_GIT_EMAIL=foo@bar.baz
MY_GIT_PAT=supersecret
SECRET_TOKEN=topsecret
```

Finally, you need an `ingress` if you intend to have an external registry
dispatch `events` to `kobold`. The below example matches the `endpoint` from the
`kobold` config.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: kobold
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - pathType: Exact
            path: /acr/107ed4ca-591a-4fee-b6b2-65ef184bb582
            backend:
              service:
                name: kobold
                port:
                  name: http
```

## Development

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) via `make` to run various commands useful for the
development.

### e2e

You can create an end-to-end setup using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and
[gitea](https://gitea.com).

```bash
make e2e-up
```

Once the stack is deployed, you can access `gitea` at <http://localhost:3000>
using `kobold` as value for both, the username and password.

The `ingress controller` of the `kind` cluster is exposed on port 8080 and 8443.
So you can publish test events to <http://localhost:8080> as this will route the
traffic to the kobold server.

`Kobold` is deployed to the namespace `kobold` and already configured to listen
for `generic` events and act on the demo `repository` in `gitea`, like shown
below. You can modify the [config.yaml](./e2e/kobold/etc/config.yaml), according
to your needs.

You can view the logs of `kobold` via:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kobold deploy/kobold
```

If you want to test code changes, you can publish a new image to the local registry and restart kobold.

```bash
make e2e-reload
```
